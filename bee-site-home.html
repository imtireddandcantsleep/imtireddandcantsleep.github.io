<p>i wanted to do something more personal for you this year, so i made a little website!! :D<br><br>i really hope you enjoy how i designed it. i specifically wanted to theme it around how i imagine a base rice could look!! it was a little bit difficult to put everything together, although it's still really simple for now !<br><br><i>//also i hope like the sparkles but i can always get ride of them hehe//</i><br><br>i know it could use a lot of work, but that's why i thought it would be super cool for us to create together. i've seen your html site for chem, and i think we could make something really fun together :)</p>
